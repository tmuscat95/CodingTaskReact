The task has some bugs but the main functionality is there.
Notably the refresh function does not seem to cause the page to rerender; meaning one must refresh the browser to see changes.
I was unable to find the cause of this in time.
the task took me a bit over 5 hours in total of actual coding, not counting breaks and set up time
(I encountered several technical difficulties trying to port the app over to react which took quite some time to figure out and fix.
I originally planned to do it in vanilla Javascript but was not able to as I have not done frontend code outside of a framework in a very long time
and never with ASP.NET Core Web API; this is why I did not do this before starting).


Given more time, I would definitely fix the styling and layout.
Please excuse also the inconsistent use of fetch and axios; I realised only near the end and decided I'd better just submit and not take anymore time
rather than go back and fix it.
